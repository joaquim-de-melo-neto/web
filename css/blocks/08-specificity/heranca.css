/* CSS provides five special universal property values for controlling inheritance. Every CSS property accepts these values.

inherit
Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as that of its parent element. Effectively, this "turns on inheritance".

initial
Sets the property value applied to a selected element to the initial value of that property.

revert
Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the browser's default styling rather than the defaults applied to that property. This value acts like unset in many cases.

revert-layer
Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the value established in a previous cascade layer.

unset
Resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the property is naturally inherited it acts like inherit, otherwise it acts like initial. */

  /* The CSS shorthand property all can be used to apply one of these inheritance values to (almost) all properties at once. Its value can be any one of the inheritance values (inherit, initial, revert, revert-layer, or unset). It's a convenient way to undo changes made to styles so that you can get back to a known starting point before beginning new changes.

  In the below example, we have two blockquotes. The first has styling applied to the blockquote element itself. The second has a class applied to the blockquote, which sets the value of all to unset.   */
