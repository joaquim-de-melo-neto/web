    <p>
        One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat
        over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching the
        grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names
        were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and
        were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all
        scientific knowledge and new discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of
        millions of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires
        without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.”
